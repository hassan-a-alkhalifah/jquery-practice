#### _Basic website with click events and alerts_

#### By _**Hassan Al-khalifah**_

## Description

_I worked this webpage for practice homework for [**Epicodus**](https://www.epicodus.com/). The project was a way for me to practice jQuery click event listeners and anonymous callback functions. By clicking on any of the HTML elements on the front end, it will cause a click event listener to be triggered which will run a anonymous callback function which will run a alert method which prompts a alert box on the front end with a message display which HTML element type was clicked._

## Setup/Installation Instructions

*_Make sure you have Git downloaded and setup on your local device._

*_Open terminal on your local device._

*_If you have not configured Git on your local device, in the terminal, you will need to set up a global configuration by entering the following:_

```
_git config --global user.name "Your first and last name"_

git config --global user.email example@gmail.com_
```
*_If you're not already in the desktop directory in your terminal, then direct yourself to the desktop directory by entering the follow in your terminal:_

`_cd Desktop_`

*_You can now begin by cloning the GitHub remote repository to your desktop. On the GitHub website with the remote GitHub repository, you will find a button colored green with the text "Clone or Download." Click the button and copy the GitHub repository URL._

*_Now in your terminal, enter the following:_

`_git clone "the GitHub repository URL you copied"_` without the quotes

*_Now your desktop should have a local copy of the cloned repository._

*_To view the webpage, in your terminal, enter the following:_

`_open index.html_`

*_The webpage should simply open in your default web browser._
